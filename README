LocalizeInput
=============

This plugin extends ActiveRecord and replaces the seperator of numbers in non us languages, .e.g german.
It uses the seperator, which comes with the I18n module. So the seperator has to be defined in the appropriate
yaml file.


Example
=======

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    # Replace seperator for attribute price to allow input with commata
    localize_input_of :price
end
